Learnt some functions from pandas, metaplotlib and seaborn 

Some important lines: df.info(), df.head(), df.describe()
df['Date'}= df.to_datetime(df.['Date'))
xxx= df.groupby('City')['Total'].sum()
xxx.plot(kind='bar', title='Monthly Revenue')
plt.ylabel('ccc')
ply.xlabel('aaa')
plt.show()

Stock/Bond with dividend cal: P=  ∑ Coupon/(1+r)^t +Par/(1+r)^N 
Zero coupon Bond price: p = c/(1+R)^t

Yield to Maturity (YTM) — Semiannual Bond
=RATE(nper, pmt, pv, fv, type) * 2   (excel)
nper = total number of semiannual periods = 2*N
pmt = semiannual coupon payment = Annual Coupon /2
​pv = present value (price), entered as negative (you’re paying it)
fv = face/par value (usually 1000)
type = 0 (payments at end of each period)
* 2 = multiply final result by 2 to get quoted annual YTM

Example
Price = $980
Par = $1,000
Annual Coupon = 8% ⇒ $80/year ⇒ $40/semiannual
Maturity = 10 years ⇒ 20 periods
=RATE(20, 40, -980, 1000, 0) * 2
YTM = 8.27%


Bond Price — Semiannual Coupon Bond
=PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv, type)
rate = semiannual YTM = Annual YTM/2
nper = total semiannual periods = 2×N
pmt = semiannual coupon = Annual Coupon/2 , entered as negative
fv = par value, also negative (cash out at maturity)
type = 0

Same bond as above, but now assume YTM is 9%:
r = 9% ⇒ r/2=4.5% per period
Semiannual coupon = $40
20 periods
FV = $1,000
=PV(0.09/2, 20, -40, -1000, 0)
Price = $935.82

Weighted-Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
WACC= wE​rE ​+ wD​rD​(1−Tc​)
Find market weights E/V and D/V. 
Compute cost of equity via CAPM
After-tax cost of debt 
Combine.

Profitability Index (PI)
PI= PV of outflows / PV of inflows ​
Discount each positive CF → sum.
Discount each negative CF → sum (use absolute value).
Ratio > 1 ⇒ NPV > 0.
